# Welcome to Adatree Design documentation

The Adatree UI is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and we use [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principles to help organise and maintain our components.

There are 3 main categories of components we use are:

1. Atoms

2. Molecules

3. Organisms

<br />

## Atoms

<div class="pt pl">

### Role

An Atom is a single reusable UI component. It is only concerned about itself and has no knowledge of the rest of the application. It should only communicate via props.

### The do's

Should use props for all values and functions.
Can use local state.

### The don'ts

Should not contain Application Business Logic.
Should not access the global shared state.
Should not contain Molecules.
Should not contain other Atoms.

</div>

<br />

## Molecules

<div class="pt pl">

### Role

A Molecule is a complex reusable UI component. A Molecule is only concerned about itself and has no knowledge of the rest of the application outside of its Molecules and Atoms. It can only communicate via props. It may use local state to manage itself.

### The do's

Should use props for all values and functions.
Can use local state.
Can contain other Molecules.
Can contain one or more Atoms.

### The don'ts

Cannot contain Business Logic.
Cannot access the global shared state.

</div>

<br />

## Organisms

<div class="pt pl">

### Role

Organisms are the brains of the application, they communicate with other Organisms by updating the Global state. They are more concerned with the applications business logic instead of HTML. They control the layout of Molecules and Atoms for their section of the application.

### The do's

Should contain the Application Business Logic.
Should determine the layout of the children Atoms and Molecules.
Can contain other Organisms.
Can contain Molecules and Atoms.
Can access the global shared state.

### The don'ts

Should not be concerned about UI elements (except layout), these should be broken down into separate Atoms or Molecules
