# Welcome to Adatree Design documentation

The Adatree UI is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and we use [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principles to help organise and maintain our components.

We use 3 main categories of components:

1. Atoms

2. Molecules

3. Organisms

<br />

## Atoms

<div class="pt pl">

### Role

An Atom is a single reusable UI component. It is only concerned about itself and has no knowledge of the rest of the application. It should only communicate via props.

### The do's

- Do use props for passing values and functions.
- Do use local state to manage its state.

### The don'ts

- Do not have Application Business Logic.
- Do not access the global shared state.
- Do not contain other Molecules.
- Do not contain other Atoms.

</div>

<br />

## Molecules

<div class="pt pl">

### Role

A Molecule is a complex reusable UI component. A Molecule is only concerned about itself and has no knowledge of the rest of the application outside of its children Molecules and Atoms. It can only communicate via props. It may use local state to manage itself.

### The do's

- Do use props for passing values and functions.
- Do use local state to manage its state.
- Can contain other Molecules.
- Can contain one or more Atoms.

### The don'ts

- Do not have Application Business Logic.
- Do not access the global shared state.

</div>

<br />

## Organisms

<div class="pt pl">

### Role

Organisms are the brains of the application, they communicate with other Organisms by updating the Global state. They are more concerned with the applications business logic instead of UI elements. They control the layout of Molecules and Atoms for their section of the application.

### The do's

- Do contain the Application Business Logic.
- Do determine the layout of the children Atoms and Molecules.
- Can contain other Organisms.
- Can contain Molecules and Atoms.
- Can access the global shared state.

### The don'ts

- Do not care about UI elements (except layout). UI elements should be broken down into separate Atoms or Molecules.
